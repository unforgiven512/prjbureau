Introduction
############

*Project Bureau* enables a fully open-source flow for Microchip_ (Atmel) ATF15xx family CPLDs_ by documenting their fuse maps and programming algorithms.

You can discuss the project at the IRC channel `#prjbureau at libera.chat <https://libera.chat>`_.

Motivation
==========

In 2020, CPLDs_ are widely considered obsolete. Why, then, work on a CPLD toolchain? Although in applications relying on reconfigurable logic alone, CPLDs are outclassed by FPGAs_ in every conceivable aspect, they still have advantages in system design: integrated configuration memory, single rail operation, powerful and rugged I/O buffers, and compatibility with 5 V TTL & CMOS systems. It is the last aspect that has motivated the research resulting in Project Bureau.

.. _FPGAs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array

Although 5 V logic has essentially disappeared from modern digital design, it did not become irrelevant. For decades, the microelectronics industry produced 5 V circuits, many of which are still in use, while others are of historical importance or pursued by retrocomputing enthusiasts. These circuits often use parallel, bidirectional buses, which are challenging to interface with today's serial, low pin count, low voltage hardware.

Microchip_ ATF15xx is the last CPLD family in active production that offers true 5 V operation, i.e. rail-to-rail 5 V outputs, providing maximum compatibility with legacy devices. (While some similar devices are still available, such as Lattice_ ispMACH4A5_, they are being phased out, employ 5 V tolerant I/O buffers rather than true 5 V ones, or both.)

Although ATF15xx devices are widely available from distributors, they are not accessible: the proprietary vendor toolchain, developed in late 1990s and last updated in mid-2000s, uses an obscure hardware definition language called CUPL_, is Windows-only, requires an expensive programming adapter, and does not properly run on anything newer than Windows XP.

.. _CUPL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_Array_Logic#CUPL

Wouldn't it be convenient if this CPLD could be used with modern open-source tools like Yosys_? Unfortunately, the vendor does not publish information required to develop a toolchain. Fortunately, it isn't necessary to rely on the vendor here.

Supported devices
=================

ATF15xx family devices are currently available in three densities: ATF1502 (32 macrocells), ATF1504 (64 macrocells), and ATF1508 (128 macrocells). Note that ATF1500_ is an obsolete device that is, confusingly, **not** a part of the ATF15xx family.

AS-series (``AS``, ``ASV`` and ``ASL`` suffixes) devices, such as ATF1502AS_, ATF1504ASV_, and ATF1508ASL_, are actively produced and widely available. BE-series (``BE`` suffix) devices, such as ATF1502BE_, ATF1504BE_, and ATF1508BE_, are produced on demand and are seldom in stock.

Virtually every aspect of the ATF15xx architecture is well-understood. However, peculiarities of the toolchain result in practical difficulties producing complete fuse map documentation. The following table summarizes the state of the project:

Installation
============

There is nothing to install! Aside from this document, the ultimate artefact of Project Bureau is a single `chip database file <database/database.json.gz>`__ containing a machine-readable description of every known fuse in every supported device. This file, together with the detailed descriptions from this document, can be used by downstream tooling to produce or manipulate fuse maps. It can also be :doc:`explored <explore>` as hypertext.

Development
===========

This project provides several :doc:`utilities <tools/index>` for manipulating fuse maps. They require Python 3.6 and the bitarray_ PyPI package. These utilities are provided for *experimental purposes only* and are intentionally not packaged; to use them, add this repository to ``PYTHONPATH``:

.. _bitarray: https://pypi.org/project/bitarray

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip3 install bitarray
   $ export PYTHONPATH=../path/to/prjbureau

Acknowledgements
================

Although I (whitequark) wrote virtually all of the code and documentation in this project, it would not exist if not for many people in the open FPGA community and beyond. I would like to express my gratitude, in no particular order, to:
